The class Room is defined with two attributes, length and breadth, both initialized to 0.0. The class also has a method called calculate_area, which calculates the area of the room by multiplying the length and breadth attributes and printing the result to the console.

Example usage:

To use the Room class, you can create an instance of the class and set the length and breadth attributes to the desired values. Then, you can call the calculate_area method to calculate the area of the room.

room = Room()
room.length = 10.0
room.breadth = 5.0
room.calculate_area()

This will output "Area of Room = 50.0" to the console, indicating that the area of the room is 50 square units.

The class Room defines a blueprint for creating objects that represent a room. It has two attributes, length and breadth, both initialized to 0.0. The method calculate_area calculates the area of the room by multiplying the length and breadth attributes and prints the result to the console.

Example usage:

To create a room object and calculate its area, we can do the following:

```
room1 = Room()
room1.length = 5.0
room1.breadth = 3.0
room1.calculate_area()
```

This will output "Area of Room = 15.0" to the console, indicating that the area of the room is 15 square units.

The class "Room" represents a room with a given length and breadth. These attributes are initialized with a value of 0.0. The class includes a function called "calculate_area" that calculates the area of the room when called.

Example usage:

room1 = Room()
room1.length = 5.0
room1.breadth = 4.0
room1.calculate_area()

This code creates an instance of the Room class called "room1" and sets its length and breadth attributes to 5.0 and 4.0, respectively. The calculate_area function is then called, which prints "Area of Room = 20.0" to the console. This indicates that the area of the room is calculated correctly as 20.0 square units.

The class Fibo contains a method called fib that takes an integer n as input and returns an integer. This method calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence recursively. 

The input parameter n must be an integer. If n is equal to 0, the method returns 0. If n is equal to 1, the method returns 1. Otherwise, the method recursively calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as inputs and returns the sum of the two results. 

This implementation of the Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of recursion in computer science. It is important to note that this method may not be efficient for large values of n due to the exponential growth of the recursive calls. 

Example usage:

f = Fibo()
print(f.fib(5)) # Output: 5
print(f.fib(10)) # Output: 55

The class Fibo contains a method called fib that takes an integer n as input and returns an integer. This method calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion. If n equals 0, the method returns 0. If n equals 1, the method returns 1. Otherwise, the method recursively calculates the nth Fibonacci number by adding the results of calling itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments. The input parameter n must be an integer, and the output is also an integer.

Example:

To use the Fibo class, you can create an instance of it and call the fib method with an integer argument. For example, to calculate the 7th Fibonacci number, you can do:

f = Fibo()
result = f.fib(7)
print(result)

This will output 13, which is the 7th Fibonacci number.

The class Fibo has a method named fib that takes an integer argument n and returns an integer value. The method implements the Fibonacci sequence formula recursively to calculate the nth term of the sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

The method checks the base cases of n=0 and n=1, and returns 0 and 1 respectively to terminate the recursion. For all other values of n, it calculates the nth term by invoking itself twice with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and then adds the results.

An example usage of the method is as follows:

fib_instance = Fibo()
print(fib_instance.fib(8)) # Output: 21

This will create an instance of the Fibo class and invoke its fib method with an argument of 8. The method will then recursively calculate the 8th term of the Fibonacci sequence and return the value 21.

The Pascal class contains a method called generate that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of lists of integers. The purpose of this method is to generate a Pascal's triangle of size n. 

The method first initializes an empty list called dp. It then loops through the range of 1 to n+1 and appends a list of zeros to dp for each iteration. This creates a 2D list of size n x n, where each row has one more element than the previous row.

The method then loops through each row and column of dp. If the column index is 0 or equal to the row index, the value is set to 1. Otherwise, the value is set to the sum of the value in the previous row and column and the value in the previous row and the current column. This calculation is based on the mathematical formula for Pascal's triangle.

Finally, the method returns the completed dp list, which contains the values of Pascal's triangle.

Example usage:

p = Pascal()
print(p.generate(5))

[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]

The given code implements a Pascal's Triangle generator using dynamic programming. The class is named Pascal and contains one method, generate, which takes an integer n as input and returns a list of lists of integers. The outer list contains n sublists, each representing a row of Pascal's Triangle. Each sublist contains i+1 integers, where i is the index of the sublist in the outer list.

The generate method first creates an empty list called dp. It then creates n sublists of increasing length, with the ith sublist containing i+1 zeros. This initializes the dp list to represent the first n rows of Pascal's Triangle.

The method then iterates over each row of dp and each element in each row. For each element, it checks if the element is at the beginning or end of the row (i.e., if its index is 0 or i). If so, it sets the element to 1. Otherwise, it sets the element to the sum of the element above and to the left and the element above and to the right in the previous row of dp. This calculation corresponds to the recurrence relation for Pascal's Triangle.

Finally, the method returns the dp list, which now contains the first n rows of Pascal's Triangle.

Example usage:

p = Pascal()
triangle = p.generate(5)
print(triangle)

Output:
[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]

The code above defines a Python class called Pascal that includes a method named "generate". This method takes an integer "n" as input and returns a list of lists that represents the Pascal's triangle up to the nth row.

To generate the triangle, the code initializes a 2D list called "dp" with "n" rows and each row containing "i" elements, where "i" ranges from 1 to "n". Then, the code loops through all the rows and columns of "dp" and uses the following logic to fill in each element:

- If the column index is 0 or equal to the row index (i.e., the element is one of the first or last elements in a row), set it to 1.
- Otherwise, set the element to the sum of the element in the same column of the previous row and the element in the previous column of the same row.

Finally, the generated list of lists is returned as the output of the "generate" method.

Example Usage:
```
pascal = Pascal()
print(pascal.generate(5))
```
Output:
```
[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]

The code defines a class called Island that has a method called maxAreaOfIsland. The method takes in a 2D list of integers called grid and returns an integer that represents the maximum area of an island in the grid. 

The method uses a depth-first search algorithm to traverse the grid and find the area of each island. It starts by checking if the current cell is within the bounds of the grid and if it is a part of an island (represented by a value of 1). If it is not, it returns 0. If it is, it marks the cell as visited by setting its value to 0 and recursively calls the dfs function on its neighboring cells. 

The dfs function returns the area of the island by adding 1 to the sum of the areas of its neighboring cells. The method then iterates through the entire grid and calls the dfs function on each cell that is a part of an island. It keeps track of the maximum area found so far and returns it at the end.

Example:
```
grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],

island = Island()
print(island.maxAreaOfIsland(grid)) # Output: 6

This documentation is for a Python class called "Island" that has a method called "maxAreaOfIsland". The method takes in a 2D list of integers called "grid" as input and returns the maximum area of an island in the grid. 

The method uses a depth-first search algorithm to traverse the grid and find the area of each island. It starts at a given cell (i, j) and checks if it is within the bounds of the grid and if it contains a 1 (indicating land). If it does, it marks the cell as visited by setting its value to 0 and recursively calls the dfs function on its neighboring cells. It keeps track of the number of cells visited during the traversal and returns that number as the area of the island.

The method then iterates through the entire grid, checking each cell to see if it is part of an island. If it is, it calls the dfs function on that cell and updates the maximum area if necessary.

An example usage of this method would be:

grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],

The above code defines a class 'Island' with a function 'maxAreaOfIsland'. The function uses Depth First Search (DFS) to find the maximum area of an island in the given grid. The input parameter to the function is a 2D-list 'grid' of integers. The function returns an integer, which is the maximum area of an island in the grid.

The function first defines a nested function 'dfs', which is the DFS function used to check the connected cells of an island. It takes in two integers 'i' and 'j' as parameters, representing the indices of the cells. If the cell values are outside the boundaries of the grid or the cell value is 0, it returns 0, else it sets the cell value to 0 (to avoid repetition of cells) and returns the sum of 1 and the recursive calls of the function to its four adjacent cells.

The function then initializes the length of the grid and sets the maximum area to 0. It then iterates over each cell in the grid, and if the cell value is 1, it updates the maximum area to be the maximum of the current maximum area and the area of the current island as given by the dfs function.

An example of how to use this function is given below:

```
grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
        [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]

island = Island()
max_area = island.maxAreaOfIsland(grid)
print("Maximum Area of Island:", max_area)
```

This will output:

```
Maximum Area of Island: 6
```

which is the maximum area of the island in the given grid.

The class Calculate contains three methods: update, solve, and calculate. The update method takes in three parameters: sign, num, and stack. If the sign is "+", the method appends the num to the stack. If the sign is "-", the method appends the negative of the num to the stack. The method then returns the updated stack.

The solve method takes in two parameters: i and s. It initializes an empty stack, a num variable to 0, and a sign variable to "+". The method then loops through the string s starting at index i. If the current character is a digit, the method updates the num variable accordingly. If the current character is "+" or "-", the method calls the update method with the current sign, num, and stack as parameters, resets the num variable to 0, and updates the sign variable. If the current character is "(", the method recursively calls itself with the index incremented by 1 and the original string s as parameters, and updates the num variable with the returned value. If the current character is ")", the method calls the update method with the current sign, num, and stack as parameters, and returns the sum of the stack and the current index. The method then increments the index by 1. After the loop, the method calls the update method with the current sign, num, and stack as parameters, and returns the sum of the stack.

The calculate method takes in a string s and returns an integer. It calls the solve method with parameters 0 and s, and returns the result.

Example:
c = Calculate()
print(c.calculate("1 + 2 - (3 + 4)"))
# Output: -4

In this example, the calculate method is called with the string "1 + 2 - (3 + 4)". The solve method is called with parameters 0 and "1 + 2 - (3 + 4)". The solve method loops through the string and updates the stack accordingly. When it encounters the "(" character, it recursively calls itself with the index incremented by 1 and the original string. When it encounters the ")" character, it returns the sum of the stack and the current index. After the loop, the solve method returns the sum of the stack. The calculate method returns the result, which is -4.

The provided code is a class called Calculate that contains three methods: update, solve, and calculate. The update method takes in three arguments: a sign (either "+" or "-"), a number, and a stack. If the sign is "+", the number is appended to the stack. If the sign is "-", the negative number is appended to the stack. The updated stack is then returned.

The solve method takes in two arguments: an index and a string. It initializes a stack, a number, and a sign. It then loops through the string, checking each character. If the character is a digit, it is added to the current number. If the character is a "+" or "-", the current number is added to the stack using the update method, and the sign is updated. If the character is an opening parenthesis, the solve method is recursively called to solve the expression inside the parentheses. If the character is a closing parenthesis, the current number is added to the stack using the update method, and the sum of the stack is returned along with the current index. If the loop finishes, the current number is added to the stack using the update method, and the sum of the stack is returned.

The calculate method takes in a string and returns an integer. It simply calls the solve method with an initial index of 0 and the provided string.

Example usage:

The class 'Calculate' defines three methods - 'update', 'solve', and 'calculate'. The 'update' method takes three arguments - 'sign', 'num', and 'stack'. If the 'sign' is '+', the 'num' is added to the 'stack', and if the 'sign' is '-', the negative 'num' is added to the 'stack'. It returns the 'stack'.

The 'solve' method takes two arguments - 'i' and 's'. It initializes 'stack', 'num' to 0 and 'sign' to '+'. It iterates over each character of the string 's'. If the character is a digit, it multiplies the previous value of 'num' by 10 and adds the current digit to it. If the character is '+' or '-', it calls the 'update' method to add the previous 'num' with the previous 'sign' to the 'stack'. It reinitializes 'num' to 0 and sets 'sign' to the current character. If the character is '(', it recursively calls the 'solve' method with 'i+1' and 's' as arguments and sets 'num' to the result and 'i' to the return value of the recursive call. If the character is ')', it calls the 'update' method to add the previous 'num' with the previous 'sign' to the 'stack' and returns the sum of all elements in the 'stack' and the current value of 'i'. Finally, it calls the 'update' method to add the last 'num' to the 'stack' and returns the sum of all elements in the 'stack'.

The 'calculate' method takes a string 's' as an argument and returns the result of calling the 'solve' method with 'i=0' and 's' as arguments.

The function first defines three dictionaries: one_digit, two_digit, and tens, which contain the English word equivalents of numbers from 1 to 9, 10 to 19, and multiples of 10 from 20 to 90, respectively. The function then defines two helper functions: get_three_digit_num and get_two_digit_num, which take a three-digit and two-digit number as input, respectively, and return their English word equivalents. 

The function then checks if the input number is 0, in which case it returns "Zero". Otherwise, it calculates the number of billions, millions, thousands, and last three digits in the input number using integer division and modulo operations. It then constructs the English word equivalent of the input number by calling the helper functions on each of these four parts, concatenating the results with appropriate spaces and suffixes, and returning the final result.

The above code defines two classes, Node and MyCalendar. The Node class represents a node in a binary search tree and has an __init__ method that initializes the start and end attributes of the node and sets the left and right attributes to None. The class also has an insert method that takes a node as an argument and inserts it into the binary search tree based on its start and end values.

The MyCalendar class represents a calendar and has an __init__ method that initializes the root attribute to None. The class also has a book method that takes a start and end time as arguments and books an event in the calendar. If the calendar is empty, the method creates a new node with the start and end times and sets it as the root. If the calendar is not empty, the method calls the insert method of the root node to insert a new node with the start and end times into the binary search tree.

Shortest resposne:
The given code defines two classes in Python: Node and MyCalendar. 

The Node class has an __init__ method which initializes the start and end attributes of the node, as well as its left and right children to None. The class also has an insert method which takes in a node argument. If the start of the incoming node is greater than or equal to the current node's end, the node is placed in the right subtree of the current node. If the end of the incoming node is less than or equal to the current node's start, the node is placed in the left subtree of the current node. If neither condition is met, the method returns False.

The MyCalendar class has an __init__ method which initializes its root attribute to None. The class also has a book method which takes in two arguments: start and end. If the root attribute is None, a new node is created with the given start and end values and set as the root node. The method then returns True. If the root attribute is not None, the insert method from the Node class is called on the root node using a new node with the given start and end values as the argument. The return value of this insert method is then returned by the book method.

An example usage of this class could be:

calendar = MyCalendar()
print(calendar.book(1, 5)) # returns True
print(calendar.book(10, 20)) # returns True
print(calendar.book(3, 7)) # returns False
print(calendar.book(2, 8)) # returns False
print(calendar.book(6, 9)) # returns True

This code defines a class ListNode that represents a node in a linked list. Each node has a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The class Solution defines a method sortList that takes a head node as input and returns a sorted linked list. 

The method first checks if the input list is empty or has only one element, in which case it returns the list as is. Otherwise, it uses a slow and fast pointer to find the middle node of the list. It then recursively sorts the left and right halves of the list using the sortList method. 

Finally, it merges the sorted left and right halves by creating a dummy node and iterating through both lists, comparing the values of the nodes and appending them to the dummy node in sorted order. The method returns the next node of the dummy node, which is the head of the sorted list.

Example usage:

head = ListNode(4)
head.next = ListNode(2)
head.next.next = ListNode(1)
head.next.next.next = ListNode(3)

solution = Solution()
sorted_head = solution.sortList(head)

# sorted_head is now a linked list with nodes in the order 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

The code provided is a Python implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm to sort a linked list. The class ListNode defines a node in the linked list, with a value and a reference to the next node. The class Solution contains the sortList method, which takes a head node of a linked list as input and returns the sorted linked list. 

The sortList method first checks if the linked list is empty or has only one node, in which case it returns the head node. If the linked list has more than one node, it finds the middle node using the slow and fast pointer technique. It then recursively calls the sortList method on the left and right halves of the linked list. 

After the left and right halves are sorted, the method merges them by creating a dummy node and iterating through the left and right halves, comparing their values and appending the smaller value to the dummy node. Finally, it returns the sorted linked list by returning the next node of the dummy node. 

Here is an example of how to use the sortList method:

```
head = ListNode(4)
head.next = ListNode(2)
head.next.next = ListNode(1)
head.next.next.next = ListNode(3)

solution = Solution()
sorted_head = solution.sortList(head)

# Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
while sorted_head:
    print(sorted_head.val)
    sorted_head = sorted_head.next

This code defines a class `ListNode` which represents a node in a linked list. The class `Solution` contains a method `sortList` which takes a head node of a linked list as an argument and returns a sorted linked list in ascending order.

The `sortList` method works by recursively dividing the linked list into two halves until it reaches a point where it cannot be further divided. It then merges the sorted halves back together to produce the final sorted linked list.

An example usage of this method can be seen below:

```
head = ListNode(4)
node2 = ListNode(2)
node3 = ListNode(1)
node4 = ListNode(3)

head.next = node2
node2.next = node3

Documentation Commentary:

The above code defines two classes, Person and Student. The Person class has three attributes: firstName, lastName, and homeCountry. The __init__ method initializes these attributes with the values passed as arguments. The class also has two methods: printName and printCountry. The printName method prints the first and last name of the person, while the printCountry method prints the home country of the person.

The Student class is a subclass of the Person class and has an additional attribute, universityName. The __init__ method of the Student class initializes the attributes of the Person class using the super() function and initializes the universityName attribute with the value passed as an argument. The class also has a method, printUniversity, which prints the name of the university.

Example:

To create a new instance of the Student class, we can use the following code:

```
student1 = Student("John", "Doe", "USA", "Harvard University")
```

This creates a new student object with the first name "John", last name "Doe", home country "USA", and university name "Harvard University". We can then call the printName, printCountry, and printUniversity methods to print the corresponding attributes of the student object:

```
student1.printName()      # Output: John Doe
student1.printCountry()   # Output: USA
student1.printUniversity() # Output: Harvard University
``` 

This example demonstrates how we can use the Person and Student classes to create objects with different attributes and methods.

The given code defines three classes: Customer, IChannel, and its two subclasses Channel and ProxyChannel. The Customer class has a constructor that takes an age parameter and initializes a private age attribute. It also has a method get_age that returns the age attribute. The IChannel class is an abstract base class that defines an abstract method provide_broadcast. The Channel class is a concrete implementation of IChannel that overrides the provide_broadcast method to print a message indicating that the broadcast has started. The ProxyChannel class is another concrete implementation of IChannel that takes a Customer object as a parameter in its constructor. It also has a channel attribute that is an instance of the Channel class. The provide_broadcast method of ProxyChannel checks the age of the customer using the get_age method of the Customer object. If the age is greater than 18, it calls the provide_broadcast method of the channel object and prints a message indicating that the service is registered for billing. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that the service is not allowed for customers under the age of 18.

Class Fibo:

The Fibo class is a Python class that contains a method called fib. The purpose of the fib method is to calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Method Signature:

The method signature for the fib method is as follows:

def fib(self, n: int) -> int:

The method takes in one parameter, n, which is an integer that represents the position of the number in the Fibonacci sequence that we want to calculate. The method returns an integer, which is the value of the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Method Description:

The fib method uses recursion to calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1.

The method first checks if n is equal to 0 or 1. If n is 0, the method returns 0. If n is 1, the method returns 1. These are the base cases for the recursion.

If n is not 0 or 1, the method calls itself recursively with n-1 and n-2 as arguments. The method then adds the results of these two recursive calls and returns the sum.

Example:

Here is an example of how to use the Fibo class to calculate the 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence:

f = Fibo()
result = f.fib(10)
print(result)

Output: 55

In this example, we create an instance of the Fibo class and call the fib method with an argument of 10. The method returns the 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence, which is 55. We then print the result to the console.

Documentation for Class Fibo:

Class Fibo is a class that contains a single method called fib(). This method takes an integer argument called n and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 0 and 1. So, the first few numbers in the sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

The fib() method in Class Fibo uses recursion to calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. If n is 0, the method returns 0. If n is 1, the method returns 1. Otherwise, the method calls itself twice with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and returns the sum of the results.

Here is an example of how to use Class Fibo:

```
# create an instance of Class Fibo
f = Fibo()

# call the fib() method with argument 6
result = f.fib(6)

# print the result
print(result)
```

This will output:

```
8
```

Parameters:
n - The index of the number to be returned in the Fibonacci sequence. (n >= 0)

Return Value:
Returns an integer representing the Nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Algorithm:
1. Check if n equals 0. If it does, return 0.
2. Check if n equals 1. If it does, return 1.
3. Otherwise, return the sum of the N-1th and N-2th numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

Example Usage:
f = Fibo()
print(f.fib(0))  # 0
print(f.fib(1))  # 1
print(f.fib(5))  # 5
print(f.fib(10))  # 55

In the above example, we create an instance of the Fibo class and call the fib method on it with different values of n. The method returns the corresponding numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.

The Pascal class contains a single method called generate which takes an integer n as input and returns a list of lists of integers. The purpose of this method is to generate the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.

The method first creates an empty list called dp. It then loops through the integers from 1 to n and appends a list of zeros to dp for each integer. This creates a list of lists with n rows, where each row has i+1 elements.

The method then loops through the integers from 0 to n-1 (i.e. the indices of the rows in dp). For each row, it loops through the integers from 0 to i (i.e. the indices of the elements in the row). For the first and last elements in each row (i.e. when j is 0 or i), the method sets the value of dp[i][j] to 1. For all other elements, the method sets the value of dp[i][j] to the sum of the element above and to the left of it (i.e. dp[i-1][j-1]) and the element above and to the right of it (i.e. dp[i-1][j]).

Finally, the method returns dp, which is a list of lists containing the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.

Example:

Here is an example of how to use the generate method:

```
p = Pascal()
triangle = p.generate(5)
print(triangle)
```

This will output:

```
[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]

The Pascal class has a generate method that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of lists of integers. The inner lists represent the rows of Pascal's triangle, with the first row being [1]. Each subsequent row is generated by adding the adjacent numbers in the previous row.

The generate method initializes a 2D list called dp with n rows and each row having i+1 elements. It then iterates through each row and column of dp, setting the value of dp[i][j] to 1 if j is 0 or i, and to the sum of dp[i-1][j-1] and dp[i-1][j] otherwise. Finally, the method returns dp, which contains the complete Pascal's triangle up to the nth row.

Example:

To generate Pascal's triangle up to the 5th row, we can create an instance of the Pascal class and call its generate method with n=5:

```
p = Pascal()
triangle = p.generate(5)
print(triangle)

Documentation for the Island class:

The Island class contains a method called maxAreaOfIsland that takes in a 2D list of integers called grid and returns an integer representing the maximum area of an island in the grid.

The method uses a depth-first search (dfs) algorithm to traverse the grid and find the area of each island. The dfs function takes in the current row and column indices (i and j) and returns the area of the island that contains that cell.

If the current cell is out of bounds or is not part of an island (i.e. has a value of 0), the dfs function returns 0. Otherwise, it marks the current cell as visited by setting its value to 0 and recursively calls itself on the neighboring cells (up, down, left, and right). The area of the island is then calculated by adding 1 to the sum of the areas of its neighboring cells.

The max_area variable is initialized to 0 and is updated with the maximum area found during the traversal of the grid. The method returns the final value of max_area.

Example usage:

# create a 2D list representing a grid
grid = [
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],

This method takes in a 2D list of integers called grid, which represents a map of an island. Each cell in the grid can either be 0 (water) or 1 (land). The goal of this method is to find the maximum area of land that can be formed by connecting adjacent land cells (either horizontally or vertically). 

The method uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the island and count the number of connected land cells. It starts at a given cell (i,j) and recursively explores its adjacent cells (up, down, left, and right) that are also land cells. Once a cell is visited, it is marked as 0 (water) to avoid visiting it again. 

The method returns the maximum area of land found by iterating over every cell in the grid and calling the DFS function on every land cell. If the current area is greater than the previous maximum area, it is updated. 

Example usage:

# Create a 2D list representing an island map
island_map = [[0,1,1,0],
              [1,1,0,0],
              [0,0,1,0],
              [0,0,0,1]]

# Create an instance of the Island class
island = Island()

# Call the maxAreaOfIsland method and print the result
print(island.maxAreaOfIsland(island_map)) # Output: 4 (the maximum area of land is a 2x2 square of land cells)

Documentation:

This code defines a class called "Island" with a method called "maxAreaOfIsland". The method takes in a 2D array of integers (called "grid") and returns an integer, which represents the maximum area of an island in the grid.

The method works by using a depth-first search algorithm to explore the connected "land" cells that make up an island. It starts at a given cell and recursively explores all neighboring cells that are also "land" cells. It also marks each explored cell as "visited" (by setting its value to 0) to avoid exploring it again.

The method then loops through all the cells in the grid and applies the depth-first search algorithm to each "land" cell it encounters. It keeps track of the maximum area seen so far and returns this value after all cells have been explored.

Example:

# Example usage of the "Island" class
island = Island()

# Define a 2D array representing a grid of "land" and "water" cells
grid = [
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
]

# Call the "maxAreaOfIsland" method with the grid as input
max_area = island.maxAreaOfIsland(grid)

# Print the maximum area of an island in the grid
print(max_area) # Expected output: 4

Class Calculate:

The Calculate class contains three methods: update, solve, and calculate. The purpose of this class is to perform basic arithmetic operations on a given string input.

Method 1: update(sign, num, stack)

This method takes in three parameters: sign, num, and stack. The sign parameter represents the arithmetic operator (+ or -), the num parameter represents the number to be added or subtracted, and the stack parameter represents the list of numbers to be operated on.

If the sign parameter is "+", the num parameter is appended to the stack. If the sign parameter is "-", the negative of the num parameter is appended to the stack. The updated stack is then returned.

Method 2: solve(i, s)

This method takes in two parameters: i and s. The i parameter represents the starting index of the string to be operated on, and the s parameter represents the string to be operated on.

The method initializes three variables: stack, num, and sign. The stack variable represents the list of numbers to be operated on, the num variable represents the current number being parsed from the string, and the sign variable represents the current arithmetic operator.

The method then iterates through the string starting from the i index. If the current character is a digit, the num variable is updated accordingly. If the current character is an arithmetic operator, the update method is called with the current sign, num, and stack parameters. The num variable is reset to 0, and the sign variable is updated to the current character.

If the current character is an opening parenthesis, the solve method is recursively called with the index incremented by 1. The num variable is updated with the returned value, and the index is updated to the index returned by the recursive call.

If the current character is a closing parenthesis, the update method is called with the current sign, num, and stack parameters. The sum of the stack is returned along with the updated index.

The method then updates the stack with the current sign and num parameters, and returns the sum of the stack.

Method 3: calculate(s: str) -> int

This method takes in a string parameter s and returns an integer. The method calls the solve method with the starting index of 0 and the input string s. The returned value is the result of the arithmetic operations performed on the input string.

Example:

c = Calculate()
print(c.calculate("1+2-(3+4)"))
# Output: -4

In this example, the Calculate class is instantiated and the calculate method is called with the input string "1+2-(3+4)". The output is -4, which is the result of the arithmetic operations performed on the input string.

Class Documentation: Calculate

This class contains methods for performing mathematical calculations on a given input string. The input string should contain mathematical expressions consisting of numbers, arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), and parentheses.

Method 1: update(sign, num, stack)

This method updates the stack based on the sign and number passed as arguments. If the sign is "+", the number is added to the stack. If the sign is "-", the negative of the number is added to the stack. The updated stack is returned.

Arguments:
- sign: sign of the number (str)
- num: number to be added to the stack (int)
- stack: current stack of numbers (list)

Returns:
- updated stack of numbers (list)

Example:
stack = [1, 2]
obj = Calculate()
stack = obj.update("+", 3, stack)
print(stack) # Output: [1, 2, 3]

Method 2: solve(i, s)

This method solves the mathematical expression starting from the index i in the input string s. It uses recursion to handle nested parentheses. It updates the stack and current number based on the current character in the input string.

Arguments:
- i: starting index of the input string s (int)
- s: input string containing mathematical expressions (str)

Returns:
- sum of the stack (int)
- index of the closing parenthesis (int)

Example:
s = "2+(3-1)"
obj = Calculate()
result, index = obj.solve(0, s)
print(result) # Output: 4

Method 3: calculate(s)

This method calculates the mathematical expression given in the input string s. It calls the solve method to perform the calculation.

Arguments:
- s: input string containing mathematical expressions (str)

Returns:
- result of the mathematical expression (int)

Example:
s = "2+(3-1)"
obj = Calculate()
result = obj.calculate(s)
print(result) # Output: 4

Class Calculate:

Description:
This class provides methods to calculate a mathematical expression represented as a string. It uses a stack-based approach to evaluate the expression.

Methods:
1. update(sign, num, stack) - This method updates the stack based on the sign and number provided. If the sign is '+', it adds the number to the stack. If the sign is '-', it adds the negative of the number to the stack. This method returns the updated stack.

2. solve(i, s) - This method evaluates the mathematical expression given as a string (s). It starts evaluating from index i in the string s. It uses a stack to store the numbers and signs encountered in the expression. It returns a tuple (result, index) where result is the final result of evaluating the expression starting from index i, and index is the index in the string s until which the expression has been evaluated.

3. calculate(s) - This method takes a string s as input, and returns the final result of evaluating the mathematical expression represented by that string. It achieves this by calling solve(0, s).

Example:
To demonstrate the usage of the class Calculate, consider the following example:

calc = Calculate()
result = calc.calculate("1+2-(3+4)-5")

The above code creates an instance of the Calculate class named 'calc', and calculates the value of the expression "1+2-(3+4)-5". The result variable will contain the value -9 (which is the correct evaluation of the expression).

Documentation for the numberToWords method in the English class:

This method takes an integer as input and returns the English word representation of that number. The input integer must be non-negative and less than or equal to 2^31 - 1.

The method first defines three dictionaries: one_digit, two_digit, and tens. These dictionaries map integers to their English word representation for numbers with one, two, and three digits respectively.

The method then defines two helper functions: get_three_digit_num and get_two_digit_num. These functions take an integer as input and return the English word representation of that number for numbers with three and two digits respectively.

The main logic of the method is to break the input number into groups of three digits (starting from the rightmost digit) and convert each group to its English word representation using the helper functions. The resulting English words are concatenated with appropriate separators (e.g. "Thousand", "Million", "Billion") to form the final English word representation of the input number.

If the input number is zero, the method returns the string "Zero".

Example usage:

english = English()
print(english.numberToWords(123456789))
# Output: "One Hundred Twenty Three Million Four Hundred Fifty Six Thousand Seven Hundred Eighty Nine"

Documentation for the class English:

The class English includes a method called numberToWords that takes an integer as input and returns the English word equivalent of the number. The method uses dictionaries to map one-digit, two-digit, and tens values to their corresponding English words. 

The method also includes two helper functions: get_three_digit_num and get_two_digit_num. These functions take a three-digit and two-digit number respectively and return their English word equivalent. 

To convert the input number into its English word equivalent, the method first checks if the number is zero. If it is, the method returns "Zero". Otherwise, the method breaks down the number into its billion, million, thousand, and last three digits components. 

The method then calls the helper functions on each component and concatenates the English words together with appropriate spacing and "Billion", "Million", or "Thousand" suffixes if necessary.

english = English()
print(english.numberToWords(123456789))

Class Node:
This class represents a node in a binary search tree. Each node has a start and end time, and can have a left and right child node. 

__init__(self, start, end):
This is the constructor method for the Node class. It takes two parameters, start and end, which represent the start and end times of the node. It initializes the start and end attributes of the node, and sets the left and right child nodes to None.

insert(self, node):
This method inserts a new node into the binary search tree. It takes one parameter, node, which is the node to be inserted. If the start time of the new node is greater than or equal to the end time of the current node, it is inserted to the right of the current node. If the end time of the new node is less than or equal to the start time of the current node, it is inserted to the left of the current node. If the new node overlaps with the current node, it cannot be inserted and False is returned. If there is no child node in the appropriate direction, the new node is inserted as the child node and True is returned.

Class MyCalendar:
This class represents a calendar that uses a binary search tree to store events. 

__init__(self):
This is the constructor method for the MyCalendar class. It initializes the root attribute to None.

book(self, start, end):
This method books an event in the calendar. It takes two parameters, start and end, which represent the start and end times of the event. If the calendar is empty, a new node is created with the start and end times and set as the root node. If the calendar is not empty, the insert method of the root node is called with a new node created with the start and end times. If the insert method returns True, the event is successfully booked and True is returned. If the insert method returns False, the event overlaps with an existing event and cannot be booked, so False is returned.

Example:
# Create a new calendar
calendar = MyCalendar()

# Book an event from 10:00 to 11:00
result = calendar.book(10, 11)
print(result) # True

# Book an event from 9:30 to 10:30
result = calendar.book(9.5, 10.5)
print(result) # False, overlaps with existing event

# Book an event from 11:00 to 12:00
result = calendar.book(11, 12)
print(result) # True

Class Node:

The Node class is used to create nodes for a binary search tree. Each node represents a time interval with a start and end time. The class has the following attributes:

- start: A variable that stores the start time of the interval.
- end: A variable that stores the end time of the interval.
- left: A variable that stores the left child node of the current node.
- right: A variable that stores the right child node of the current node.

The class also has a method called insert, which takes a node as an argument and inserts it into the binary search tree. The method returns True if the node was successfully inserted and False otherwise.

Example:

To create a node with a start time of 10 and an end time of 20:

node = Node(10, 20)

To insert a node into the binary search tree:

root = Node(5, 15)
node = Node(20, 30)
root.insert(node)

Class MyCalendar:

The MyCalendar class is used to create a calendar that can book time intervals. The class has the following attributes:

- root: A variable that stores the root node of the binary search tree.

The class also has a method called book, which takes a start and end time as arguments and books the time interval in the calendar. If the calendar is empty, the method creates a root node with the given start and end times. If the calendar is not empty, the method inserts a node with the given start and end times into the binary search tree. The method returns True if the time interval was successfully booked and False otherwise.

Example:

To create a calendar:

calendar = MyCalendar()

To book a time interval with a start time of 10 and an end time of 20:

The Node class represents a node in a binary search tree used to store intervals. Each node has a start and end value, representing the interval it stores, as well as left and right children which are also Node objects.

The __init__ method initializes a Node object by setting its start and end values to the arguments provided, and its left and right pointers to None.

The insert method takes another Node object as an argument and attempts to insert it into the binary search tree. If the argument's interval is completely to the right of the current node's interval, it attempts to insert the node into the right subtree (creating it if necessary). If the argument's interval is completely to the left of the current node's interval, it attempts to insert the node into the left subtree (creating it if necessary). Otherwise, it returns False indicating that the interval overlaps with an existing interval and cannot be inserted.

The MyCalendar class represents a calendar for booking intervals. It contains a single attribute, root, which is a Node object representing the root of the binary search tree.

The __init__ method initializes a MyCalendar object by setting its root to None.

The book method takes a start and end value representing the interval to be booked. If the calendar is empty (i.e. root is None), it creates a new Node object representing the interval and sets it as the root. Otherwise, it calls the insert method of the root Node object with a new Node object representing the interval as the argument. If the insert method returns True, the booking was successful and the method returns True. Otherwise, the booking was unsuccessful (due to a scheduling conflict) and the method returns False.

Example:

Assuming the following code has been executed:

calendar = MyCalendar()
calendar.book(1, 3)
calendar.book(8, 10)
calendar.book(3, 5)
calendar.book(2, 4)
calendar.book(7, 9)

The resulting binary search tree will be:

           (1,3)
             / \
        (3,5)  (8,10)
        /   \
    (2,4)   (7,9)

This represents the intervals [1,3], [2,4], [3,5], [7,9], and [8,10] which have been successfully booked in the calendar.

The above code defines a class ListNode which has two attributes - val and next. The class Solution has a method sortList which takes a ListNode object as input and returns a sorted ListNode object.

The method first checks if the input ListNode object is empty or has only one element. If so, it returns the same object as it is already sorted.

If the input object has more than one element, the method uses the merge sort algorithm to sort the elements. It first finds the middle element of the list using two pointers - slow and fast. The slow pointer moves one step at a time while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer points to the middle element.

The method then splits the list into two halves - left and right - using the middle element. It recursively calls the sortList method on both halves to sort them.

Finally, the method merges the two sorted halves using a dummy node and a current node. It compares the values of the first elements of both halves and adds the smaller one to the current node. It then moves the current node to the next position and repeats the process until one of the halves becomes empty. It then adds the remaining elements of the other half to the current node.

The sorted list is returned by the method.

Example:

# create a linked list with unsorted elements
head = ListNode(4)
head.next = ListNode(2)
head.next.next = ListNode(1)
head.next.next.next = ListNode(3)

# create an object of the Solution class
s = Solution()

# call the sortList method on the linked list
sorted_head = s.sortList(head)

# print the sorted linked list

Documentation:

The above code implements the merge sort algorithm to sort a linked list. It defines a class `ListNode` which represents a node in the linked list, and a class `Solution` which contains the `sortList` method that sorts the linked list.

The `sortList` method takes a head node of the linked list as input and returns the sorted linked list. It first checks if the linked list is empty or contains only one node, in which case it returns the same linked list.

If the linked list contains more than one node, it finds the middle node using the slow and fast pointer technique. It then recursively sorts the left and right halves of the linked list.

After sorting the left and right halves, it merges the two sorted halves using a dummy node and a current node. It compares the values of the nodes in the left and right halves and adds the smaller value node to the current node. It continues this process until one of the halves becomes empty. It then adds the remaining nodes of the other half to the current node.

Finally, it returns the next node of the dummy node which represents the sorted linked list.

Example:

Consider the following linked list: 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3

The sorted linked list would be: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

To sort this linked list using the `sortList` method, we would create the head node of the linked list and call the `sortList` method as follows:

```
head = ListNode(4)
head.next = ListNode(2)
head.next.next = ListNode(1)
head.next.next.next = ListNode(3)

solution = Solution()
sorted_list = solution.sortList(head)

print(sorted_list.val)  # Output: 1
print(sorted_list.next.val)  # Output: 2
print(sorted_list.next.next.val)  # Output: 3
print(sorted_list.next.next.next.val)  # Output: 4

The implementation of the sortList function uses merge sort algorithm to sort the linked list in ascending order. The function takes the linked list head and recursively divide it into two halves using a slow-fast pointer approach. Once the pointers have been divided into two halves, the function starts to merge the left and right parts using a dummy node, which helps to avoid any invalid memory access errors.

This file contains the definition of two classes: Person and Student.

Class Person:
    __init__(self, firstName, lastName, homeCountry):
        Initializes the Person object with the given firstName, lastName, and homeCountry.
        Params:
            firstName (str): The first name of the person.
            lastName (str): The last name of the person.
            homeCountry (str): The home country of the person.

    printName(self):
        Prints the first and last name of the person.

    printCountry(self):
        Prints the home country of the person.

Class Student(Person):
    __init__(self, firstName, lastName, homeCountry, universityName):
        Initializes the Student object with the given firstName, lastName, homeCountry, and universityName.
        Params:
            firstName (str): The first name of the student.
            lastName (str): The last name of the student.
            homeCountry (str): The home country of the student.
            universityName (str): The name of the university the student is attending.

    printUniversity(self):
        Prints the name of the university the student is attending.

Example:

# Creating Person object
person = Person("John", "Doe", "USA")

# Printing Person's name and home country
person.printName()
person.printCountry()

# Creating Student object
student = Student("Jane", "Doe", "Canada", "University of Toronto")

# Printing Student's name, home country, and university name
student.printName()
student.printCountry()
student.printUniversity()

The code above defines three classes: Customer, IChannel, Channel, and ProxyChannel.

The Customer class has a constructor that takes an age parameter and initializes a private attribute called __age. It also has a method called get_age that returns the value of __age.

The IChannel class is an abstract base class that defines a single abstract method called provide_broadcast. This method has a docstring that simply says "broadcasting".

The Channel class is a concrete implementation of the IChannel interface. It overrides the provide_broadcast method and simply prints the message "Broadcast started...".

The ProxyChannel class is another implementation of the IChannel interface. It takes a Customer object as a parameter in its constructor and initializes a private attribute called customer with it. It also initializes a Channel object and stores it in a private attribute called channel.

The ProxyChannel class overrides the provide_broadcast method and first checks the age of the customer by calling the get_age method. If the customer is over 18, it calls the provide_broadcast method of the channel object and prints the message "this service is registered for billing.". If the customer is under 18, it simply prints the message "sorry, this service is not allowed for the customers under the age of 18.".

Example:

Here's an example of how to use these classes:

# create a customer object with age 20
customer = Customer(20)

# create a proxy channel object with the customer object
proxy_channel = ProxyChannel(customer)

# call the provide_broadcast method of the proxy channel object
proxy_channel.provide_broadcast()

# output: 
# Broadcast started...
# this service is registered for billing.

In this example, we create a Customer object with age 20 and a ProxyChannel object with the Customer object. We then call the provide_broadcast method of the ProxyChannel object, which checks the age of the customer and calls the provide_broadcast method of the Channel object if the customer is over 18. The output shows that the broadcast started and the service is registered for billing.

Documentation:

The code above defines three classes: Customer, IChannel, Channel, and ProxyChannel.

The Customer class has a constructor that takes an age parameter and initializes a private age variable. It also has a method called get_age that returns the age value.

The IChannel class is an abstract class that defines a single abstract method called provide_broadcast. This method is intended to be implemented by subclasses.

The Channel class is a concrete implementation of the IChannel class. It overrides the provide_broadcast method and simply prints a message indicating that the broadcast has started.

The ProxyChannel class is another implementation of the IChannel class. It takes a Customer object as a parameter in its constructor and initializes a Channel object. The provide_broadcast method checks the age of the customer using the get_age method and if the customer is over 18, it calls the provide_broadcast method of the Channel object and prints a message indicating that the service is registered for billing. If the customer is under 18, it simply prints a message indicating that the service is not allowed.

Example:

Here is an example of how to use the ProxyChannel class:

# create a customer object with age 20
customer = Customer(20)

# create a proxy channel object with the customer object
proxy_channel = ProxyChannel(customer)

# call the provide_broadcast method of the proxy channel object
proxy_channel.provide_broadcast()

# output:
# Broadcast started...
# this service is registered for billing.

Documentation:

The above code defines three classes: Customer, IChannel, and ProxyChannel.

Customer class: This class initializes an object with an age attribute and a method to get the age of the customer.

IChannel abstract class: This class is an abstract class that defines the method 'provide_broadcast' as an abstract method. This method is not implemented in this class. It is used to provide a template for the Channel and ProxyChannel classes to implement.

Channel class: This class extends the IChannel abstract class and implements the 'provide_broadcast' method. When the method is called, it prints "Broadcast started...".

ProxyChannel class: This class also extends the IChannel abstract class and implements the 'provide_broadcast' method. When the method is called, it first gets the age of the customer object that was passed in the constructor. If the age is greater than 18, it calls the 'provide_broadcast' method of the Channel object and prints "this service is registered for billing." If the age is less than or equal to 18, it prints "sorry, this service is not allowed for the customers under the age of 18."

Example:

Let's create a customer object and a proxy channel object to demonstrate the functionality of the code.

customer = Customer(20)
proxy_channel = ProxyChannel(customer)

# calling the provide_broadcast method on proxy_channel object
proxy_channel.provide_broadcast()

Output:
Broadcast started...
this service is registered for billing.
